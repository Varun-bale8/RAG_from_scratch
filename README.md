# RAG_from_scratch
“My first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built from scratch using Python and LLMs.”
1)🧠 Let’s Build Your First RAG System From Scratch

Forget expensive APIs and proprietary databases.
In this project, we build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch using open-source tools that real engineers rely on.

2)🚀 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but face three critical issues:

Hallucination — They generate confident but false answers.

Stale Knowledge — They can’t access new or private data.

Data Privacy — Sending private data to external APIs is risky.

💡 Goal: Build a local, private, and intelligent Q&A system that can retrieve company-specific knowledge and generate accurate, context-grounded answers — without using OpenAI APIs.

3)📊 Data Source

We used a custom company policy manual as our knowledge base:

Company Policy Manual:
- WFH Policy: All employees are eligible for a hybrid WFH schedule. Employees must be in the office on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Mondays and Fridays are optional remote days.
- PTO Policy: Full-time employees receive 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) per year. PTO accrues monthly.
- Tech Stack: The official backend language is Python, and the official frontend framework is React. For mobile development, we use React Native.


This serves as the private dataset our RAG system learns from.

4)🧩 Tools & Libraries Used
Library                                              	Purpose
transformers	                        To load and use the LLM for text generation
sentence-transformers                 To create text embeddings
faiss-cpu	Vector database             for semantic search
langchain	                            For smart text chunking/splitting
numpy	                                For numerical operations

5)🧠 Key Learnings

Grounding LLMs: By retrieving relevant context, we make the model factually accurate.

Privacy by Design: No external API calls — all computations are local.

Modular Design: You can plug in new documents to instantly update the knowledge base.

Scalability: The same architecture can power enterprise-grade knowledge assistants.
